## Game Overview

### Project Background
Vintage Goes AR is a leading gaming company specializing in reviving classic games through immersive AR experiences. As part of our collaboration, we are excited to present the AR version of the iconic Asteroids arcade game.

### High-Level Concept
- **Game Name:** Asteroids AR
- **Target Devices:** Mid- to high-end mobile phones, Android and iOS
- **Target Audience:** Action game enthusiasts, AR game aficionados, and classic arcade game fans
- **Release Date:** Next Summer
- **Publisher:** Vintage Goes AR

In "Asteroids AR," players are transported to outer space where they defend Earth from incoming asteroids and UFO saucers. Engage in intense gameplay, earn points, and unlock mystery prizes as you destroy these celestial threats.

## Game Objective

The primary goal of Asteroids AR is to obliterate asteroids and UFOs that pose a threat to Earth. Destroying a large asteroid splits it into smaller pieces, which, when hit again, break down further. However, beware: asteroids move towards Earth with a slight directional offset, and they can inflict damage on both the player and Earth. If the player's health or Earth's health reaches zero, the game ends.

## Gameplay

### Scoring
Players can earn the following points for demolishing asteroids and UFO saucers:
- Small Asteroid: 100 points
- Medium Asteroid: 50 points
- Large Asteroid: 20 points
- UFO: 100 points

### Player Mechanics
- Your camera's view serves as the player's perspective, with Earth in the background.
- Asteroids spawn in front of you and traverse towards Earth.
- Rotate and move your phone to aim at asteroids.
- Tap the screen to shoot; bullets originate from the screen's center and travel straight ahead.
- If asteroids reach your camera's position, they inflict damage.
- Your health is affected by asteroid collisions; a health bar displays your remaining health.

### Earth
- Earth is a sizable sphere positioned behind you.
- Asteroids crashing into Earth cause damage; smaller asteroids deal less harm.
- The Earth's health bar is visible on-screen.
- If Earth's health depletes (reaches 0), the "game over" screen appears.

### Asteroids
- Asteroids spawn on the opposite side of Earth; vertical spawning is limited.
- After spawning, asteroids head towards Earth.
- Larger asteroids split upon impact.
- Asteroids vanish upon reaching your camera's view or when destroyed by bullets.
- Asteroids damaging Earth or colliding with bullets meet the same fate.

### UFO
- UFOs emerge randomly in front of the player's initial position.
- Each UFO traverses your line of sight.
- UFOs shoot bullets toward the player; bullets cannot be destroyed and cause damage upon contact.
- Destroying a UFO triggers a mystery box, releasing a recovery Health Item if destroyed by the player.

## User Interface

- Health bar indicating the player's remaining life.
- Health bar displaying Earth's remaining health.
- Current score counter.

Thank you for exploring the Asteroids AR game concept. We're excited to bring this exhilarating AR experience to you next summer. Stay tuned for updates as we work on creating an unforgettable game!
